                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>1994: HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, a Norwegian technologist at CERN, proposed the idea of CSS at a Web
                            conference in Chicago. The proposal was met with discussion, as some thought it was too
                            simple
                            and that a full programming language was needed to style documents.
                            1996: The first version of CSS, CSS1, became a W3C Recommendation.
                            1998: CSS 2 was released, and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was published as a set of separate
                            documents, or modules, instead of a single specification.
                            2011: CSS 2.1 was released to fix errors in CSS 2.</p>

                        <h3>Vision</h3>
                        <p>The Vision is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
                            Created
                            by Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema, the character first appeared in The Avengers #57
                            (published in August 1968).[1][2][3] The Vision is loosely based on the Timely Comics
                            character
                            of the same name who was an alien from another dimension. The character is an android
                            (sometimes
                            called a "synthezoid") built by the villainous robot Ultron created by Hank Pym. </p>

                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>Goal-setting theory was formulated based on empirical research and has been called one of the
                            most important theories in organizational psychology.[2] Edwin A. Locke and Gary P. Latham,
                            the
                            fathers of goal-setting theory, provided a comprehensive review of the core findings of the
                            theory in 2002.[3] In summary, Locke and Latham found that specific, difficult goals lead to
                            higher performance than either easy goals or instructions to "do your best", as long as
                            feedback
                            about progress is provided, the person is committed to the goal, and the person has the
                            ability
                            and knowledge to perform the task.</p>
